iPhone 12 Pro Max

# Description

The iPhone 12 Pro Max is Apple's most ambitious iPhone yet, and naturally commands a steep premium too. In my iPhone 12 Pro review, I mentioned that even though the smaller Pro model is a superb offering, it's probably not the smartest choice. If you are thinking of going all-out on your iPhone purchase this year, then you should probably look at spending a bit more and getting the iPhone 12 Pro Max instead.
